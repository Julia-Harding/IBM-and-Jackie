				<h1>Meet Jackie, IBM's New Mascot for Neurodiversity</h1>
				<h3>Loraine Trapani</h3>
				<p>When Loraine Trapani took in her seventh Guiding Eyes dog, she expected the usual routine. A puppy usually spends eight to twelve months with a raiser, then moves onto a professional trainer. After an intensive training, the puppies are then paired with their new owner.</p>
				<p>Jackie, however, was not able to fully complete her training. Loraine discovered that Jackie suffered from epileptic seizures, which are very rare for Guiding Eyes' puppies. Because of her condition, Jackie was unable to become a guide dog.  After considering the special circumstances, Lorraine decided to adopt Jackie and put a hold on raising puppies.</p>
				<h3>Jackie's Epilepsy</h3>
				<p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which brain activity becomes erratic. Seizures often occur, along with abnormal behavior and loss of awareness during an episode. Because Jackie has epilepsy, she has become IBM’s mascot for neurodiversity. Jackie has made a huge impact on the IBM community by bringing awareness for neurodivergence and helping to create a more accepting environment within the company.</p>
				<p>Jackie is also paving the way for new technology. Her smart collar monitors her health and warns Loraine of Jackie’s seizures. The collar is a huge advancement for medical technology, and scientists are working to improve the collar’s features. It is possible that, in the near future, the collar could predict the occurrence of a seizure through monitoring changes in Jackie’s gait.</p>
